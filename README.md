# neural-network-and-handwritten-digit-classifier
This is a neural network library built upon a handmade matrix library.

This is made with the purpose of solving the classic mnist handwritten digit image classification problem dubbed the "hello world" of machine learning.

The binary for the compiled library can be found in bin alongside another binary in which main is instead replaced with xor_main.
This is made with the purpose of solving xor, for the purpose of 
testing the algorithm.

# notes
The binary only works on linux, in order to test for other systems this needs to be recompiled.
